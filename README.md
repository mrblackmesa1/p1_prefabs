# Aperture Escape Prefabs
A collection of Portal 1 prefabs we have made for use in internal maps
Even if these are interally used prefabs, they have all the features you would expect from valve ones and more such as logic_relays for a majority of elements like buttons, switches, doors etc

## --PLEASE CREDIT IF YOU USE THEM--


## Current prefabs:

**BTS:**
Office ceiling light

**CHAMBER (chmb):**
Floor Button
Timed Switcch

**GLOBAL (gbl):**
Map Ents // Place 1 of them in your maps to have all the entities you need.

## Installation
I personally recommend you move an entire folder such as: `prefabs_bts` folder into:
 `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Portal\bin\Prefabs`
 This is so in hammer you can easily select from where you want a prefab and don't have to scroll for ages!
Of course you can still place all of them together, just look at the all_prefabs folder
