# Aperture Escape Prefabs
A collection of Portal 1 prefabs we have made for use in internal maps,
These have improvements to valve ones such as including trigger_relays for most of the elements.

## --PLEASE CREDIT IF YOU USE THEM--


## Current prefabs:

**BTS:**
Office ceiling light

**CHAMBER (chmb):**
Floor Button
Timed Switcch
chamberlock

**GLOBAL (gbl):**
Map Ents // Place 1 of them in your maps to have all the entities you need.

## Installation
I personally recommend you move an entire folder such as: `prefabs_bts` folder into:
 `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Portal\bin\Prefabs`
 This is so in hammer you can easily select from where you want a prefab and don't have to scroll for ages!
Of course you can still place all of them together, just look at the all_prefabs folder
