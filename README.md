# Portal 1 Prefabs
A collection of Portal 1 prefabs I have made or taken from the official maps
In the future I will accept user submitted prefabs to be added!

## Current prefabs:

**BTS:**
Office ceiling light

**CHABMER (chmb):**
Floor Button


## Installation
I personally recommend you move an entire folder such as: `prefabs_bts` folder into:
 `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Portal\bin\Prefabs`
 This is so in hammer you can easily select from where you want a prefab and don't have to scroll for ages!
