# Aperture Escape Prefabs
A collection of Portal 1 prefabs we have made for use in internal maps
These ones are used internally for map macking purposes but we have decided to give them out so anyone can use thm.

--PLEASE CREDIT IF YOU USE THEM

## Current prefabs:

**BTS:**
Office ceiling light

**CHAMBER (chmb):**
Floor Button


## Installation
I personally recommend you move an entire folder such as: `prefabs_bts` folder into:
 `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Portal\bin\Prefabs`
 This is so in hammer you can easily select from where you want a prefab and don't have to scroll for ages!
